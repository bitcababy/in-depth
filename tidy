	<p>Students keep asking, “Why doesn’t the Math Department just use teacherweb?” One student even asked whether we’re too cool for teacherweb.</p>
	<p>The WHS Math Department admits to being cool, but that’s not what westonmath is all about. The westonmath.org website is far more than a place to find out tonight’s homework assignment. Here are some of its features:</p>
	<ul>
		<li> The “Current Assignment” automatically rolls over every afternoon. The teacher doesn’t have to remember to do so manually. Future assignments aren’t confused with the current one.</li>
	<li>You have an easily accessible database of all past assignments. Even in June it stretches all the way back to September.</li>
		<li>	Teachers have access to past assignments in every course going back to 2002. This is extremely helpful for experienced teachers and newcomers alike.</li>
	<li>Westonmath is course-oriented rather than teacher-oriented. Students, parents, and teachers can easily find out 
	important information about a course, such as its syllabus and its grading policies. Even if there are four or five different 
	teachers for a course, all the course-wide data are collected in a single place.</li>
	<li>Department-wide information is readily available on the front page.</li>
	</ul>
